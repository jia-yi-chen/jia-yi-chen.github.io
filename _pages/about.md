I am a Ph.D. candidate at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) majoring in [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science). 
I am advised by Prof. [Aidong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O8XxkE4AAAAJ&hl=en).
My research interests are broadly in Machine Learning and Data Mining, with the focuses on Multimodal Machine Learning, Graph Mining, Continual Learning, Federated Learning, and Model-efficient Transfer Learning.

Prior to PhD, I received my Bachelor's degree in Automation Engineering in 2015 and Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering in 2018 from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). I was affiliated with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics during 2015-2018, under the supervision of Prof. [Nanning Zheng](https://research.com/u/nanning-zheng) and Prof. [Xuguang Lan](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/Xuguang-Lan/2498428), working on projects related to Computer Vision, 3D Neural Stylistic Rendering, and Robotics.

I also did summer internships at Google in 2022 and 2023, working on Multimodal Few-shot Learning, LLMs, and Efficient Personalization.
