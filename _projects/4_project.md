- Built an autonomous framework on TurtleBot to act as a human security guardâ€”wandering, finding AprilTag targets, approaching each target, aiming and then shooting the target with a motorized toy gun installed on TurtleBot. 
- Developed the target searching/ranking, goal-position and gun-pitch calculation, and go-to-goal functions (ROS, python).
