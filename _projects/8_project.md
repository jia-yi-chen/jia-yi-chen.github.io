- Proposed a graph-factorized Gaussian Process VAE to disentangle the underlying dynamic systems of partially observed spatiotemporal interactions between multiple subjects; and then robustly generate imputed data or future data based on learned disentangled representations.
- Proposed a heterogeneous hyper-node graph for the multi-task multimodal alignment task.
- Proposed a dynamic graph-based federated learning approach for privacy-preserving personalized task adaptation with heterogeneous domain shifts and modality types.
