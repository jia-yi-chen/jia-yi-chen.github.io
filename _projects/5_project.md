#### Deep Reinforcement Learning for Human-like Car-Following System
- Leveraged an Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning framework to learn personalized car-following behaviors from empirical data
- Employed [Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) to learn the continuous-control policy network.
