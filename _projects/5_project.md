#### Project:
Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to design a Human-like Car-Following system
- Leveraged an Actor-critic Reinforcement Learning framework to learn personalized car-following behaviors from empirical data
- Employed [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) to learn the continuous-control policy network.
