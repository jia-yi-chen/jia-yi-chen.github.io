#### Project:

Directly using the Motion Vectors (MV) from the compressed MPEG-4 video bitstreams to achieve fast Human Action Recognition, bypassing video decoding process and avoiding pixel-domain analysis.
- Extract MV-based Spatial-temporal Interest Points from video bitstream instead of from the decoded video
- Leverage MV motion features for classification--using traditional BoW and Fisher Vector followed by SVM as the framework.
