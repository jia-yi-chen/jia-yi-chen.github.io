#### Project:

Directly using the Motion Vectors (MV) from the compressed MPEG-4 video bitstreams, which achieves Fast Human Action Recognition bypassing video decoding that avoids pixel-domain analysis.
- Proposed to extract MV-based Spatial-Temporal Interest Points from video bitstream instead of from the decoded video
- Formed motion features using BoW and Fisher Vector and trained classifiers like SVM
