Extracted motion vectors (MV) from MPEG-4 video bitstreams; proposed an MV-based method to fast detect Spatial-Temporal Interest Points from video bitstream instead of from the decoded video; formed motion features using BoW and Fisher Vector and trained classifiers like SVM (tools: Matlab, C++, OpenCV, Linux).
