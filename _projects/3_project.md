#### Time:
12/2015 – 12/2016

#### Project: 

This project is centered around a theoretical search-and-rescue mission. The task is building an application that enables a drone to 
- autonomously take off from a moving vehicle,
- collect data on the whereabouts of survivors and transmit the information from the disaster site back to the vehicle, then 
- land autonomously on the same moving vehicle.

#### Contributions:

- Target Detection module: developed a real-time Vision-based module (including Object detection and 3D localization) on Drone’s autonomous navigation system. Real-time 3D poses of objects are estimated from 2D images using the real-time camera gimbal data based on Homography and 3D Geometry.
- Go-to-goal module: developed an autonomous tracking-and-landing module for autonomous landing on a still/moving vehicle. 
- Developed a framework managing multimodal sensors, which makes decisions from real-time feedbacks collected from cameras, drone states, and others sensors, duing Drone's navigation
- Information display on APPs.
- Designed and Setup the testing environments (collaborating with the team) to evaluate the Drone's mission.
- Conducted 100+ outdoor tests using Matrice 100 and real trucks (collaborating with the team), tuning the hyperparameters to guarantee drone’s landing safety.

#### Accomplishment: 
- Achieved ≤10cm autonomous landing accuracy. 
- Won the <i>4th Place in World Top10</i> in the <a href="https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-kicks-off-2016-dji-developer-challenge">International Contest of "2016 DJI Drone Developer Challenge</a>” taking place in New York, USA.
          There were a total of 130+ international participants.
          The contest was hosted by 
          <a href="https://www.undp.org/about-us">United Nations Development Programme</a>, <a href="https://www.dji.com/">DJI</a>, and <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2016/01/05/ford-targets-drone-to-vehicle-technology.html">Ford</a>.
          A video is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIRkzH3cTAM">here.</a>
- Later, we extend the demo to another project that involves communication & interaction between Drone and Ground Vechile, allowing a collaboration between aerial autonomous robots and ground autonomous robots.
