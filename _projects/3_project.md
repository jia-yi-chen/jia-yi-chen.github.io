- Keywords: Robot Manipulation, Robot Perception, 3D Computer Vision, C++, Robotic Operating System 
- Developed a real-time Vision-based module (including Object detection and 3D localization) on Drone’s autonomous navigation system. Real-time 3D poses of objects are estimated from 2D images using the real-time camera gimbal data based on Homography and 3D Geometry.
- Developed an autonomous tracking-and-landing module for Drone landing on a moving vehicle with safety guarantee, and designed a platform to manage multimodal sensors and commands (tools: Python, Linux, ROS).
- Won the 4th place from 130+ international teams in “2016 DJI Developer Challenge”, NY, USA (as a team of three).
